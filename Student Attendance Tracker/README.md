# 📚 Student & Class Tracker

A simple yet effective desktop application (built with **Python Tkinter**) to **manage class schedules, track student attendance, and add class comments**.

## ✨ Why I built this

My workplace recently opened, and as a teacher, I noticed we lacked a **proper system** to:
- Know **what classes** were currently active.
- See the **attendance history** of students.
- Record **important notes** about classes (like missing explanations, important reminders, or special situations).

This project started as a **fun experiment**, but it's now something that could actually help **teachers** stay organized — and **improve class quality**!

## 🛠 Features

- **Class List Management**  
  Add, edit, and delete class schedules easily.

- **Student Attendance Tracking**  
  Record who is present or absent during a class and save it automatically.

- **Comments & Feedback**  
  Leave comments for each class session (ex: what was missing, what to improve).

- **Easy to Use**  
  Simple GUI (Graphical User Interface) with a colorful and clean design.

- **Data Storage**  
  Stores data locally using `.txt` files (`class_data.txt` and `absent_data.txt`).

- **Date & Time Sorting**  
  Automatically sorts classes based on the day and start time.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- **Teacher's Diary**
  - Allow teachers to create personal notes during or after classes.

- **Student Profiles**
  - Store student preferences, learning styles, parent expectations, and past history.
  - Allow student transfer between teachers while keeping important info.

- **Presence Reminder**
  - Automatically pop up the attendance form **after the class ends**, so it's hard to forget!

- **Multi-Teacher Login**
  - Add login support, so different teachers can manage their own classes safely.
