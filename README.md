# Python-Projects ðŸš€
Welcome to Python-Projects repository by Ahmad Yazid!

I first touched Python when I became a teacher. At the beginning, I was simply teaching the basics to my students â€” again and again â€” until, without even realizing it, I became good at it myself!

This repository is a collection of the projects I've created while exploring the Python language. Each project reflects something new I learned or experimented with. It's a journey of growth, curiosity, and lots of trial and error!

### ðŸŒŸ What's inside?

- Beginner to intermediate Python projects
- Concepts I explored while teaching and learning
- Code that's written with simplicity and clarity in mind (perfect for fellow learners) with some touch of AI (duh!)

### ðŸŒ± Still learning:
I'm constantly improving, trying out new ideas, and having fun with Python. Feel free to explore, use, or contribute! 
Or better yet, tell me directly on where and what to improve!
