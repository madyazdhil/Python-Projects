# Code Quest Challenge 📝✨

Welcome to the **Code Quest Challenge** project!

This project was created to make learning programming more engaging and accessible for my students. I used to pass around my iPad with exercises generated by ChatGPT or other LLMs, but it became tiring with multiple students. Now, with this app, students can access challenges directly on their devices, check their answers, and get feedback—allowing me to step back and enjoy being a spectator!

## 🚀 Features

- Generate personalized **programming exercises** based on chosen language and topics.
- Support for multiple programming languages and customizable challenges.
- Real-time **answer checking** with feedback using an AI-powered API.
- Track progress with **question counts**, attempts, and a final summary report.
- Interactive web interface built with Flask for easy access on any device.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3
- Flask (web framework)
- Requests (for API calls)
- Python-dotenv (for environment variable management)
- Gunicorn (production WSGI server for deployment)
- Waitress (development WSGI server for Windows)
- OpenRouter AI API (for generating exercises and feedback)

## 🧠 How It Works

- Students select a programming language, topics, hero name, challenge count, and difficulty on the **index page**.
- The app generates the **first exercise** via an AI API and presents it on the **QuestionsAnswer page**.
- Students submit answers, receiving **feedback** and tracking **attempts left**. Correct answers advance to the next question.
- After completing all challenges, a **summary report** with feedback is displayed on the **result page**.

## 💡 Inspiration

As a teacher, I wanted to challenge my students after they learned a programming language, but manually managing exercises for multiple students was exhausting. This app leverages AI to create a self-service learning tool, making it easier for students to practice and for me to observe their progress!

## 🏗️ Future Improvements

- Add support for more programming languages.
- Include a leaderboard for friendly competition.
- Allow saving student progress across sessions.
